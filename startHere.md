# Requirements for Training Website

## Website

- Domain : training.gluu.org
- We can see if we can adapt the current wordpress template
- We need to modify a script to split the page in half (left and right) for Wordpress page on one side and Console on the other
- Initial page gives basic directions, asks for user (user@ip) and set up a password (if not preset at registration)

## Payment

- Paywall set up options:
    1. We make courses that are made up of blocks of training (that are reusable for multiple courses)
    1. We include with VIP access (or at least provide advanced tutorials at this level)
    1. We sell by subscription.
- Set up notification that payment is received/customer is registered
- Set up an email template for customer with instructions and credentials

## Mechanics
- Link user registration and login to training
- Set up either a time limit to finish an individual training program or a time-out to free up resources. Server resets or spins down at the end of timer
- Students get a certain number of tickets for questions based on the complexity of their course or potentially can purchase additional tickets
