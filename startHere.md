# Training

Some notes on how we should approach building these training modules (from Sam):

- The end goal is modular, single-feature training courses that we can chain together into curriculum to teach a full concept or product. For example, we won't have Gluu Community Edition training as a course, we'll have "Two Factor Authentication in the Gluu Server."
- The best way to accomplish this is to form a list of topics and to have the support team or other experts who regularly work with customers to help them achieve specific goals provide guides and tips to consistently provide results.
- I'll organize and assemble the guides and content that we have into curriculum, designing lessons where appropriate, video content where appropriate, and maximizing the effectiveness of the training. 
- We should always teach toward an outcome, never to show off a feature of a product. Marketing our products should be a natural part of the training, not openly its purpose.
- To break this down, each course will, when finished, be in this format:
    1. What are you looking to do? What's the desired outcome? For example: Add 2FA to login options.
    1. What concepts do you need to understand and implement to get this outcome? For example: IAM platform, interception scripts, forms of 2FA, etc.
    1. What software and/or hardware do you need to implement these concepts? For example, Gluu Server, Yubikeys, etc. More options are always better.
    1. How do you use the described software to achieve the desired outcome?
    1. What do you need to sustain that outcome? Maintenance, etc.
- Non-crucial history, theory, and anecdotes weaken training by adding unnecessary fluff.
- I'll add more tips and guidelines as we get content and it becomes apparent.
